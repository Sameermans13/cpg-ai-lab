### The Business Problem
Even with advanced retailer segmentation, a common challenge remains: how to translate high-level strategic personas into concrete, daily actions for the sales team. Sales representatives are often overwhelmed with a long list of tasks and limited time during a store visit, leading to inconsistent execution of strategy.

### The AI Solution
This project directly solves that problem by **operationalizing the insights** from our multi-layered segmentation model. It is a prescriptive analytics tool that acts as a "smart assistant" for sales representatives.

The engine takes a store's unique, multi-layered profile, which includes its:
- **Trend Adoption Segment** (e.g., "Early Adopter")
- **Business Value Segment** (e.g., "High-Growth Star")
- **Product Mix Segment** (e.g., "Ice Cream Specialist")

It then uses a **business rules engine** to score a master list of potential monthly sales activities against this specific profile. The result is a simple, prioritized list of the **Top 3 most impactful actions** for the salesperson to take during their visit, ensuring their limited time is spent on the most strategic activities.
