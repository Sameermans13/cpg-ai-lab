### The Business Problem
A critical question in the CPG industry is determining the true return on investment (ROI) of trade promotions. Traditional analysis often relies on simple revenue lift, failing to account for product margins, baseline sales, or the initial plan. This leads to an incomplete and often misleading picture of a promotion's real impact on the bottom line.

### The Solution (No AI here)
This accelerator is a professional-grade analytics tool that provides a complete **Plan vs. Actual** analysis for promotional events, with a strategic focus on **Margin-Based ROI**.

The system integrates a comprehensive data model that includes:
-   A master promotion plan with projected lifts, spend, and tactics.
-   A data-driven weekly baseline forecast for non-promoted sales.
-   Actual weekly sales results.
-   Product-specific margin data.

The dashboard allows a user to select any historical promotion and instantly see a detailed breakdown of its performance, from high-level summaries down to the individual product and store level. This turns historical data into a powerful tool for planning future, more profitable promotions which we will explore in our next accelerator.
