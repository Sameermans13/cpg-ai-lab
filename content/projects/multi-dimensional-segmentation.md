### The Business Problem
Traditional retailer segmentation is often one-dimensional and static, grouping stores by last year's sales volume alone over longer range data. This simplistic approach fails to capture the true nature of a retail partner, especially as it goes through several demand side patterns. It cannot distinguish between a large, stagnant store and a smaller, high-growth store that is rapidly adopting new product trends.

### The AI Solution
This project builds a sophisticated, multi-layered segmentation engine that analyzes retailers through three independent strategic lenses:

1.  **Trend Adoption**: Using sales data for "New Era" vs. "Traditional" products, this model identifies which retailers are **Early Adopters** of new trends versus **Traditional Strongholds**.
2.  **Business Value**: Using revenue and growth metrics, this model segments retailers into personas like **"High-Growth Stars"** and **"Stable Cash Cows."**
3.  **Product Mix**: This model analyzes the product assortment to find **"Chocolate Specialists," "Ice Cream Destinations,"** or **"Balanced Confectioneries."**

The system uses **Unsupervised Machine Learning (K-Means Clustering)** to discover these segments and then leverages a **Generative AI (Google's Gemini)** to automatically create strategic personas and actionable recommendations for each group. What makes this stand out further is the aspect that this solution directly **integrates back to the CRM solution** to update the retailer segmentation automatically, and even further maintains the **historical changes in segmentation** so that sales strategists can understand the shifts even better.
