### The Business Problem
In the CPG industry, inaccurate demand forecasting leads to two costly problems: stockouts (lost sales) and overstocks (wasted capital and expired product). Traditional forecasting often relies on simple historical averages and fails to capture complex patterns like holidays, seasonality, and recent trends.

### The AI Solution
This project showcases a predictive analytics tool that uses a time-series AI model (Meta's Prophet) to generate accurate, SKU-level demand forecasts.

The model was trained on a hyper-realistic, multi-year dataset that includes patterns for:
- Weekly and yearly seasonality
- Holiday spikes
- The impact of promotions
- The momentum of "New Era" vs. "Traditional" products

Below is a short video walkthrough demonstrating the application's capabilities.

The tool provides not only a visual forecast but also a set of actionable business metrics, including the expected sales volume for the next 30, 60, and 90 days, and an analysis of the product's underlying growth trend.
