### The Business Problem
CPG companies generate and consume vast amounts of market research, trend reports, and internal competitive analyses. However, this wealth of information often sits in static documents, making it difficult for teams to quickly extract specific answers, synthesize insights, or find information relevant to a new strategic question without sifting through hundreds of pages.

### The AI Solution
This project introduces an AI-powered conversational agent that transforms static market research documents into an interactive knowledge base. Leveraging **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, this application allows users to ask natural language questions and receive precise, contextually relevant answers directly from a curated collection of documents.

The system is designed to:
- Ingest and index multiple research reports (e.g., industry trends, consumer surveys, competitive landscapes).
- Understand nuanced natural language queries.
- Retrieve the most relevant passages from the documents.
- Synthesize an answer based on the retrieved information, citing sources where applicable.

This dramatically reduces the time spent on manual research, empowering brand managers, R&D, and strategic teams to get answers faster and make more data-informed decisions.
