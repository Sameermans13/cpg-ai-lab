For over two decades, I have operated at the intersection of business strategy and technology within the Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) industry. My career has been dedicated to helping industry leaders navigate complex challenges across the value chain, from supply chain optimization and sales effectiveness to brand marketing.

The seismic shift towards data and Artificial Intelligence isn't just a technological evolution; it's a complete business revolution. Recognizing this, I've embarked on an ongoing, hands-on journey to not only understand these new tools but to build with them. My goal is to bridge the often-vast gap between high-level AI strategy and practical, on-the-ground implementation, leading into closing the loop to drive industry & business relevance of these technologies.

This website serves as my digital notebook and a platform to share my experiments, learnings, and strategic insights. Here you will find:
* **Analysis** on how AI is reshaping CPG capabilities.
* **Hands-on projects** where I build and test AI-powered tools to solve real business problems.
* **Frameworks** and thought leadership on navigating digital transformation.

Intent of this website is not just in advising *on* AI strategy, but in developing understanding of what it truly takes to bring it to lifeâ€”from the datasets to the machine learning models, embedding the output into business processes resulting in value unlock.

Let's connect and discuss how we can build the future of CPG, together.
